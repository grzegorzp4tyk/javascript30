# JavaScript30

My jorunal of getting through __JavaScript30__ challenge by *Wes Bos*.

## Day 01 - Drum Kit
What did I learn?

+ key events in javascript
+ element[attribute="value"] syntax works the same as in css
+ `transitionend` event - gets fired when the transition of the element ends ([docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/transitionend_event))
